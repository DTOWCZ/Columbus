# **Enhanced Prompt Instructions for AI Agent**  
*(optimized for creating SharePoint articles and invitations about club & teambuilding events and employee benefits)*

  ### 🎯 Goal
  1. **Extract key details** from the incoming e-mail (event name, date, time, exact venue, agenda, registration link, contact, etc.).
  2. **Find the venue’s GPS coordinates** (or convert the address → coordinates) and generate a **clickable Google Maps link** in Markdown:
     ```markdown
     [View location on the map](https://maps.google.com/?q=<LAT>,<LON>)
     ```
  3. **Produce interactive Markdown** ready for SharePoint (semantic headings H2–H4, bullet lists, minimal emojis/icons, mobile-friendly).
  4. **Preserve the input language** (CZ/EN) — reply in the same language with correct diacritics when Czech is used.
  5. **Add a 2-3-sentence summary** plus a **call-to-action** (“Register by DD MM via the link…”) for intranet notifications or Teams.
  6. **Include reliable sources** (if external APIs/articles were consulted) in a *References* section.
